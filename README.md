## Additional Information

In this assignment I utilized Polymorphism in the form of the calculate_area and calculate_perimeter, which
are defined in the superclass and utilized differently in each subclass.

Abstraction in the form of calculate_area and calculate_perimeter being abstract methods, which allows users
to use these methods at a high level without needing to know how the formulas are carried out.

And finally inheritance, where I defined common methods and attributes, and then had each subclass inherit those methods
and use their own implementation of them
